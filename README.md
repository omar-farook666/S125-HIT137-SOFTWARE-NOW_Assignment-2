# Temperature Data Analysis – HIT137 Assignment 2 (Question 2)

This project processes temperature data from multiple weather stations across Australia (1986–2005). It calculates seasonal temperature statistics and identifies significant stations based on their readings.

## Features

- Calculates average temperatures for each **season** (Summer, Autumn, Winter, Spring).
- Identifies the station with the **largest temperature range**.
- Finds the **warmest and coolest stations** based on average annual temperature.

## Files Generated

- `average_temp.txt` – Seasonal average temperatures.
- `largest_temp_range_station.txt` – Station(s) with the largest temperature range.
- `warmest_and_coolest_station.txt` – Warmest and coolest stations.

## How to Use

1. Place all CSV files inside a folder named `temperature_data`.
2. Run the Python script:
3. Output files will be generated in the same directory.

## Requirements

- Python 3
- pandas
